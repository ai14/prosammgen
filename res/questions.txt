Why do these intended learning outcomes exist?  Who has an interest?
Is Computer Science special as a field of academic study?
Find one or two of the Master's degree learning outcomes that you think could be more clearly addressed in the courses you are currently taking.  If possible, be specific about which courses and how.
We have plans to change the "track" structure by replacing the current pools of courses with smaller (15 hp) blocks consisting of one theory and one project course, both tightly connected to a local research group.  The students would then have to take two such blocks as their 30 hp specialization.  Do you think this may change future students' chances to get "considerable degree of specialised knowledge in certain areas of the field as well as insight into current research and development work"? Can you think of any other consequences?
Only first year students (prosamm14): Are you planning to change your study technique in some way this year?
