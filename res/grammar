// README
// This file defines the grammar for report generation.
//
// Terminal symbols and non-terminal symbols are tab-delimited.
//
// Two slashes on the beginning of a line is a comment.
// Words starting with # are production rules. A production rule must be on the form #[A-Z]+ but may be directly followed by another rule or terminal symbol.
// Words starting with % are predicates. A predicate take arguments and is substituted with a value.
//
// Available predicates:
// %MARKOV(Number of sentences) is substituted with markov chain generated text.
// %SYNONYM(Word 1,Word 2,...,Word n) is substituted with a random joint synonym of the n input words. Note that whitespace is part of the word.
// TODO Add %KEYWORD(sentence) predicate.

// TODO Make grammar describe an entire reflection document (set of question/answer pairs) instead.
