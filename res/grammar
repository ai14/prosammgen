// README
// This file defines the grammar for the report generation.
//
// Terminal symbols and non-terminal symbols are tab-delimited.
// The first symbol on each line is the left-hand side in a production rule. The remaining symbols make up the right-hand side.
// Lines beginning with two slashes is a comment and is stripped by the parser.
// Words starting with # are production rules. A production rule must be on the form #[A-Z]+.
// Words starting with % are predicates. A predicate is a dynamic terminal symbol used by the parser.
//
// Available predicates:
//   %MARKOV(Number of sentences) is substituted with markov chain generated text.
//   %SYNONYM(Word 1,Word 2,...,Word n) is substituted with a random joint synonym of the n input words. Note: whitespace sensitive.
//   %KEYWORD() is substituted with the keyword, determined by the parser.

// TODO: talk more about courses and stuff like that

#PARAGRAPH	#FILLER
#PARAGRAPH	#CONTEXT	#OPINION	#ARGUMENT	#ARGUMENT	#CONCLUSION

#FILLER	It is difficult to decide where to begin...
#FILLER	Things are very uncertain.
#FILLER	Who knows how things will change.
#FILLER	I just love this question!
#FILLER	This is a subject I feel very strongly about.
#FILLER	I have only been here for a while, so I wish I knew more about this issue.
#FILLER	I can finally talk about this!
#FILLER	Is this really a serious assignment? I wouldn't consider this even worth talking about.

#CONTEXT	#CPRELUDE	#CCONCLUSION	%MARKOV(2)
#CONTEXT	Society today shows some disregard towards subjects that interest academia.
#CONTEXT	It is well known that the	%KEYWORD()	affects everybody in this course.
#CONTEXT	I don't know how the others will feel about	%KEYWORD().

#CPRELUDE	Considering recent developments,
#CPRELUDE	With all of the	%SYNONYM(drama)	going on,
#CPRELUDE	According to many students I have talked to,
#CPRELUDE	In light of recent events,
#CPRELUDE	As I understand it,
#CPRELUDE	I don't know about others; but to me,

#CCONCLUSION	%KEYWORD()	is an issue that is not getting	%SYNONYM(enough)	%SYNONYM(attention).
#CCONCLUSION	one might say that	%KEYWORD()	has gotten a	%SYNONYM(bad,good)	rap recently.
#CCONCLUSION	%KEYWORD()	is not all that interesting.
#CCONCLUSION	it feels like	%KEYWORD()	is being taken way too seriously.
#CCONCLUSION	a lot is still	%SYNONYM(unknown,unclear,controversial)	about	%KEYWORD()	.
#CCONCLUSION	I would need to gather more information about	%KEYWORD()	to form a clear opinion.
#CCONCLUSION	%KEYWORD()	is something that everybody should talk more about.

#OPINION	#OQUAL	#OOP

#OQUAL	I feel like
#OQUAL	One could say that
#OQUAL	There is no doubt, then, that
#OQUAL	I suspect everybody %SYNONYM(thinks,believes) that
#OQUAL	I know that
#OQUAL	I don't know about others, but to me it is clear that
#OQUAL	What I want to say, then, is that
#OQUAL	Without a doubt,
#OQUAL	With some hesitation, I would say that

#OOP	one needs to do something about this.
#OOP	there should be more discussions in this area.
#OOP	this needs to be changed.
#OOP	there is not much to be done about the situation.
#OOP	more effort could be spent in this area.
#OOP	it is up to my fellow students to get more involved.
#OOP	far too many are trying to solve the problem.
#OOP	there are too many unknowns for there to be an easy solution.

#ARGUMENT	#ARGCTX	#FACT	%MARKOV(3)

#ARGCTX	The best indication for this is
#ARGCTX	What everybody probably notices is
#ARGCTX	It might not be clear to everybody, but
#ARGCTX	It is no doubt true that
#ARGCTX	Most things point towards that
#ARGCTX	What convinces me is
#ARGCTX	I firmly believe that

#FACT	people such as	#FAMOUSPERSON	already	#ACTION	.
#FACT	the research in the area is conclusive.
#FACT	no more needs to be said on the matter.
#FACT	there are many groups involved in making changes happen.
#FACT	everybody can make a difference.
#FACT	people are trying.
#FACT	research hasn't proven anything yet.
#FACT	there is too many people who disagree for it to be believable.
#FACT	it is impossible to say for sure what's going on.
#FACT	someone like	#FAMOUSPERSON	might be the only person who previously	#ACTION	.
#FACT	we can't put our trust in	#FAMOUSPERSON	, as has been shown before.
#FACT	things get confusing, really quickly.
#FACT	if	#FAMOUSPERSON	were present, the discussion would be much more	%SYNONYM(clear,interesting,informed)	.
#FACT	nothing more can be said about it.

#ACTION	#APREFIX	#REALACTION
#ACTION	#REALACTION

#APREFIX	(as isn't unheard of)
#APREFIX	(not too surprisingly)
#APREFIX	, which I consider to be very inspirational, by the way,

// TODO: consider different tenses here
#REALACTION	tried, and failed
#REALACTION	successfully applied the theory
#REALACTION	talked about the issue at great length
#REALACTION	considered everything we have suggested
#REALACTION	thought about it
#REALACTION	voiced some theories
#REALACTION	had a lecture about this
#REALACTION	wrote a book on the subject
#REALACTION	must have been bored enough to even address the issue

// TODO: this can be split into more segments
#CONCLUSION	I hope that this is not considered too controversial!
#CONCLUSION	I am very interested to see if somebody agrees with me!
#CONCLUSION	But who knows, maybe I'm just babbling...
#CONCLUSION	I'm not feeling like I'm very qualified to talk about this, though.
#CONCLUSION	In general, this gives me hope, and I will continue to follow the progress!
#CONCLUSION	It is of course very controversial to even talk about this.
#CONCLUSION	Since it's not the end of the world, I'm not too worried, however.
#CONCLUSION	That's really all I can say about the situation today.
