// README
// This file defines the grammar for the report generation.
//
// Terminal symbols and non-terminal symbols are tab-delimited.
// The first symbol on each line is the left-hand side in a production rule. The remaining symbols make up the right-hand side.
// Lines beginning with two slashes is a comment and is stripped by the parser.
// Words starting with # are production rules. A production rule must be on the form #[A-Z]+.
// Words starting with % are predicates. A predicate is a dynamic terminal symbol used by the parser.
//
// Available predicates:
//   %MARKOV(Number of sentences) is substituted with markov chain generated text.
//   %SYNONYM(Word 1,Word 2,...,Word n) is substituted with a random joint synonym of the n input words. Note: whitespace sensitive.
//   %KEYWORD() is substituted with the keyword, determined by the parser.
